Start the server:

$ perl /suse/jblunck/baracus-zvm-server/baracus-zvm-proxy.pl

The server is listening on the socket /var/run/bazvmproxy.socket (or whatever
you define in $socketpath). UDEV is forwarding the uevent to that socket with
the following rule:

KERNEL=="smsgiucv_app" SUBSYSTEM=="iucv" ACTION=="change" RUN+="socket:/var/run/bazvmproxy.socket"
